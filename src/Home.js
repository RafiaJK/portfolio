        Coding has been a career years in the making - from 2007 when I'd update my MySpace weekly to make sure my Top 8 stayed up to date, my latest favorite song played, and my layout matched my latest mood.
        A couple short years later I found myself on Tumblr, once again customizing my theme to my latest favorite aesthetic.  
        <br></br>
        It was while I was working in social media that I realized I loved creating for a living and finding new ways to catch peoples attention on their screens.
