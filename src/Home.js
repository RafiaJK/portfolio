      <h3>üìç New York</h3>
      <p> I'm a full-stack developer. 
        <br></br><br></br>
        Coding has been a career years in the making - starting with HTML and CSS when I'd update my MySpace profile weekly to make sure my Top 8 stayed up to date, my new favorite song played, and my layout matched my latest mood.
        A couple short years later I found myself on Tumblr, once again customizing my theme to my latest favorite aesthetic.  
        <br></br>
        It was while I was working in social media that I realized I loved creating for a living and finding new ways to catch peoples attention on their screens.
